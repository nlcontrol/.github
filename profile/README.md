# Nonlinear Control Systems Group

The group is a leading Estonian research unit in automatic control, focusing on nonlinear control systems, including non-smooth, hybrid and time-delay systems. The group has made significant contributions to the development of constructive algebraic methods and the associated symbolic software package NLControl, which supports research, teaching and applications.

A universal algebraic methodology has been developed that simplifies the study of very different problems for nonlinear control systems from a unified perspective. The main idea is to construct sequences of subspaces (or submodules) of differential 1-forms that provide a lot of information about the structural properties of the system. For instance, an event-based resource-aware control method based on the concept of differential flatness has been developed.

Although the group is developing predominantly application-independent general methods determined by the dynamic properties of the mathematical models, we have been recently focused on a few carefully chosen applications, some of them addressed within the joint topics in the Estonian Centre of Excellence on IT, our group is part of. These include control of autonomous underwater vehicles and ionic polymer-metal composite actuators. Within the last few years, special attention has been paid to the study of practical problems arising in limits of renewable energy integration, and to determining the possible limitations of distributed energy storage devices in low inertia power systems utilizing methods from optimal control theory.
